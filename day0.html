							<h3> COVID-19 Protocols and Masking Policy</h3>
							<p> There is clear emperical data that mask wearing and airflow minimise the spread of COVID-19 virus in indoor gatherings and helps protect those with pre-existing conditions that may be exacerbated by a COVID infection.  
							<b> We ask that attendees use N95, KN95, KF94, or FFP2  masks (or their equivalents) in the meeting spaces</b>, except when consuming food or beverages.  The organisers will provide these masks for free for any who need them. Presenters will be allowed to remove their masks during their presentations, and members of the audience asking questions will be able to lower their masks to speak as needed. <p>
							<p> If you do test positive for COVID-19 during or shortly after the meeting, please let the organisers know so we can make attendees aware about the possible exposure. </p>
